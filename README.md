# Beckn-ONIX

Beckn-ONIX is [FIDE](https://fide.org/) project aimed at easing setup and maintainance of a [Beckn](https://becknprotocol.io/) Network using reference implementations. Objectives include setting up reliable, configurable and fast Beckn network as a virtual appliance. This initiative is independent of the evolution of the Beckn protocol. This effort is also aimed at inviting contributions from the community to create secure, reliable builds for production environments.

Within the install folder you will find a `beckn-onix.sh` file which is an installer that helps create a multi-node Beckn network using reference implementations
