# Beckn-ONIX

Beckn-ONIX is [FIDE](https://fide.org/) project aimed at easing setup and maintainance of a [Beckn](https://becknprotocol.io/) Network using reference implementations. Objectives include setting up reliable, configurable and fast Beckn network as a virtual appliance. This initiative is independent of the evolution of the Beckn protocol. This effort is also aimed at inviting contributions from the community to create secure, reliable builds for production environments.

## GUI Installer

There is a community contributed browser based GUI installer to install multi-node reference implementation Beckn network. Refer to the [Installation Guide](./onix-gui/GUI/README.md) and [wizard guide](./onix-gui/README.md) for details.

## CLI Installer

For those familiar with CLI, there is a command line installer to install multi-node reference implementation Beckn network. Refer to the [User Guide](./docs/user_guide.md) and [Setup Walkthrough](./docs/setup_walkthrough.md) for details.
