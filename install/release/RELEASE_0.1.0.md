# Release Notes

## Beckn-ONIX Version 0.1.0 (2024-02-16)

### Objective

Beckn-ONIX - Open Network In A Box, is a utility designed to effortlessly set up all Beckn components on a machine using a one-click installer. This tool serves as a valuable resource for developers and network participants eager to explore Beckn protocols or join open networks supported by the Beckn protocol. By simplifying the installation process, Beckn-ONIX streamlines the onboarding experience.

The current version installs all components automatically without requiring user input, facilitating a seamless setup process. However, we are committed to further enhancing Beckn-ONIX's functionality. In the upcoming release, we will introduce the capability to selectively install specific components and accommodate user-provided configurations.
